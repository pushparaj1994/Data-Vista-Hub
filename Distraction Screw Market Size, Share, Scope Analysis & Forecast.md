In orthopedics, distraction screws are crucial for bone lengthening and correction of deformities. Surgeons use these screws in conjunction with distraction osteogenesis to gradually elongate bones, improving patient mobility and functionality. This application is particularly prevalent in pediatric orthopedics, where the demand for effective limb lengthening solutions is high. The orthopedic segment is characterized by ongoing advancements in screw materials and designs, aimed at enhancing patient outcomes and reducing recovery times. As technology evolves, new innovations continue to emerge, driving further growth in this sector of the market.</p><p>In the dental sector, distraction screws are employed primarily for maxillofacial surgeries, including the correction of congenital jaw deformities and the reconstruction of facial structures. They are integral in facilitating the movement of dental bones and supporting the alignment of the jaw for improved function and aesthetics. The demand for distraction screws in dental applications is fueled by increasing cases of traumatic injuries and congenital abnormalities, as well as rising awareness about advanced surgical techniques. Additionally, the development of more precise and less invasive distraction screw designs is contributing to the market's expansion in the dental field. Both segments are witnessing substantial growth due to technological advancements and increasing procedural demands.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=643254&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=277</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Distraction Screw Market  worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Medline</Li><Li> TeDan Surgical Innovations</Li><Li> B.
