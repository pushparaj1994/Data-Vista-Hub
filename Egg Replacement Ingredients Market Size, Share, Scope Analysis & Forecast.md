Similarly, in sauces and dressings, egg replacements play a critical role in emulsion and thickening processes, offering a viable solution for those who avoid eggs due to dietary restrictions or allergies. The demand for clean label and allergen-free products is pushing manufacturers to explore and implement effective egg replacement solutions across these diverse applications.
